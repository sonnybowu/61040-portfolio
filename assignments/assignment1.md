## Three Selected Domains (with explanations)

### 1. Consulting / Skills Requesting Platform
People often encounter challenges they don’t have the skills or confidence to solve—whether it’s debugging a tech issue, writing a resume, or seeking creative feedback. Platforms like Fiverr exist but are designed around predefined gigs, making them a poor fit for open-ended or exploratory problem-solving. I’m interested in a platform where users can describe their issue and receive tailored advice from verified consultants. Ideally, the system could match users to remote advisors or nearby experts who could offer in-person support when needed. This idea reflects personal experiences of needing help with technical or creative work and not knowing where to turn.

### 2. Returns & Warranties Tracker
Returns and warranties are meant to protect consumers, but many people lose that protection because they misplace receipts or forget deadlines. I’ve personally forgotten to return or register products in time, leading to wasted money. A tool that scans receipts and automatically extracts key dates—such as return windows or warranty periods—could help users stay on top of deadlines. This could be particularly useful for students or professionals who purchase expensive electronics, appliances, or tools, and want to maximize their value and protection.

### 3. Second-Hand Courier Platform
Many people use platforms like Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist to buy second-hand items. These platforms are convenient, sustainable, and often more affordable. However, they come with logistical problems: arranging pick-up times, borrowing a vehicle, or transporting large items. I’ve seen deals fall through because the buyer couldn’t pick up the item or the seller wasn’t available. A courier-based model, similar to Uber or DoorDash but for goods instead of food, could make second-hand commerce more accessible. It would enable users to buy what they want without the friction of logistics.

## Problems by Domain (3 each)

### Consulting / Skills Requesting Platform
- **Finding the right expertise** – People often don’t know who to ask when they need help, especially for niche or interdisciplinary problems.  
- **Trust & credibility** – Even when someone is available to help, it’s hard to judge whether they’re qualified, especially in online platforms.  
- **Local availability** – Some problems require hands-on help, like setting up hardware or in-person tutoring. Finding someone nearby can be difficult.

### Returns & Warranties Tracker
- **Lost receipts** – Without proof of purchase, users may lose eligibility for returns or warranties.  
- **Deadline reminders** – Users often forget about return windows or warranty periods, especially if the product didn’t fail right away.  
- **Warranty confusion/tracking** – Terms of service are often vague or buried in fine print, and users don’t know what’s covered or when.

### Second-Hand Courier Platform
- **Lack of transportation** – Not everyone owns a car or has access to one, especially in urban areas. This limits participation in second-hand exchanges.  
- **Lack of time** – Buyers and sellers may not be available at the same time, making in-person exchanges hard to coordinate.  
- **Trust & safety** – Inviting a stranger to your home or meeting in public can be risky; couriers introduce another layer of complexity.

## Three Selected Problems

### A. Lack of Time (Second-Hand Courier Platform)
Scheduling conflicts between buyers and sellers often derail second-hand exchanges. Sellers may be available during the day while buyers are free at night—or vice versa. Even when both parties are interested, coordinating a pickup time can stretch over days or weeks. This problem increases transaction friction and can cause good deals to fall through. A courier system that decouples the buyer-seller meetup—like how DoorDash lets you order food without meeting the chef—would eliminate the need for scheduling alignment.

### B. Deadline Reminders (Returns & Warranties Tracker)
People frequently forget to return unwanted items or make warranty claims within the allowed window. This often results in them being stuck with products they don’t want, or paying for repairs they could have had covered. A digital system that scans receipts and sends deadline notifications could solve this. It would remove the burden of manually tracking return policies or warranty terms and ensure users get the value they’re entitled to.

### C. Lack of Transportation (Second-Hand Courier Platform)
Transportation is a huge barrier in second-hand commerce. A buyer may find the perfect couch or desk, but if they don’t have access to a car or van, the transaction can’t happen. Even if they’re willing to pay for the item, they simply can’t get it home. A courier service that lets users request pickup and drop-off—like Uber for second-hand goods—would unlock access for buyers who are otherwise excluded due to lack of mobility.

## Excluded Problems

### Consulting
- **Finding the right expertise** – While a real issue, solving it well would require building a large expert pool and advanced matching logic—difficult to scope for a single project.
- **Trust & credibility** – This is better handled through features like rating systems or ID verification.  
- **Local availability** – GPS-based filters or toggles can address this; not a core design challenge.

### Returns & Warranties
- **Lost receipts** – Many tools already store receipts; the more critical issue is tracking time-sensitive actions.  
- **Warranty confusion** – Parsing legal language is complex and difficult to scale in a reliable way.

### Second-Hand Courier
- **Trust & safety** – While important, this is a solvable feature through vetting, reviews, and in-app communication. It’s not the core barrier.

## Stakeholders & Impacts

### Consulting / Skills Requesting
- **End-users** – People seeking help with real-world problems, from tech support to creative feedback.  
- **Consultants / Experts** – Individuals offering guidance, who benefit from access to more clients.  
- **Communities / Institutions** – Could host or validate expert pools.  
**Impact:** A more effective system builds trust and democratizes access to knowledge and expertise.

### Returns & Warranties
- **Consumers** – Want to recover value but often miss opportunities due to poor tracking.  
- **Retailers** – Benefit when consumers act within return policies and reduce dispute rates.  
- **Manufacturers / Warranty Providers** – Reputation improves when warranties are used effectively and not misunderstood.  
**Impact:** Better tracking and communication improve satisfaction and reduce friction across the return ecosystem.

### Second-Hand Courier
- **Buyers** – Want to purchase large or faraway items but lack the means.  
- **Sellers** – Want to complete transactions quickly without negotiating logistics.  
- **Couriers** – Want gig work that fits their schedule and pays fairly.  
**Impact:** A courier system unlocks second-hand transactions that would otherwise not happen due to logistics barriers.
